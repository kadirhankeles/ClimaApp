# Clima App
I have created a weather app that allows users to check the temperature of any city they want. They simply type in the name of the city and the app displays the current temperature. 
## What did I learn in this project?

 - Pulling data from internet using URLSession **(Api & JSON)**
 - Modeling JSON data
 - TextField operations
 - Show data from internet in application interface
